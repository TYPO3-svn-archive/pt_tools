pt_tools collectionElementSelector Manual

Introduction
------------

The collectionElementSelector in pt_tools can be used to build web forms
in TYPO3 frontend plugins where elements of an object collection are
displayed as a list together with buttons or other form elements that
would perform an operation on the related single collection element.
It provides also a possibility to add an additional form block for
operations on the collection as a whole, e.g. add an additional element.
The collectionElementSelector is especially usefull when used in combination
with pt_tools' formTemplateHandler but can be used independent of it.

What it does is basically loop through all collection elements and
create an individual form for each element. To differentiate the 
returns from the forms of different elements, the collectionElementSelector
puts metadata into the individual fields (as hidden forms) that will be
used in identifying which form sent a given input.
All the forms for the individual elements are concatenated together in
the so called "element list"; in addition a so called "extra block" can
be generated that is not related to a single element but to the collection
as a whole.

Requirements
------------

The collectionElementSelector only works on object collections that implement
pt_tools' abstract class.tx_pttools_objectCollection.php

API
---

+ Constructor

  $cesObject = new tx_pttools_collectionElementSelector($this, $templates, $wrapperDesc);

  Instantiate a collectionElementSelector Object that will provide the
  methods described below; usually you would do that near the start of
  your plugins main() method.
  The first parameter is your plugin object (in the normal case of using this
  directly in a frontend plugin $this would be used).
  The second and third parameters are optional and would only be used if you
  want to use special templates to wrap individual collection elements and/or
  the extra block for the collection as a whole or you want to wrap the
  element list together with the extra block in a nonstandard way.

+ Generating form output

  $content = $cesObject->displayCES($selectorName, $objCollection, $elementDisplay, $extraDisplay);

  This method collects output from methods provided by you to generate forms
  for single collection elements and the extra block and wraps them all
  together in a common html-string; also metadata is inserted in the forms
  so the other methods can identify user input from one of these forms.
  The first parameter is a simple string used to identify the selector form
  that is built here. It is most useful if your plugin generates more then
  one selection form; so the input handler can use getCESName() to find out
  which form generated a given input.
  The second parameter is the object collection that you want to select/display
  elements of.
  The third paramater is the name of a public method provided by yourn plugin;
  this method will be called once for every collection element with this element
  as its only parameter and has to return a filled in form for this element.
  The optional fourth parameter is likewise the name of a public mthod in your
  plugin; this one is called with the whole collection as its single argument
  and must return a filled in form for the "extra" block.

+ check if we are called from a collection element selector form

  $cesObject->isCESReturn();

  Method to be called from the plugin; this one checks piVars for the
  presence of CES metadata and returns true if found.

+ get name of selector form we were called from

  $selectorName = $cesObject->getCESName();

  Can be called by plugin if isCESReturn() returned true: Returns the
  selector name found in CES metadata.

+ get Id of collection element that was in the form we were called from

  $elementId = $cesObject->getCESId($objCollection);

  Can be called by plugin if isCESReturn() returned true: Returns the
  Id of the collection element whose form was submitted by the user
  or an empty string if the user submitted the "extra" block form.

+ process input from a collection element selector form

  $msg = $cesObject->processCESInput($objCollection, $elementProcess, $extraProcess);

  Can be called by plugin if isCESReturn() returned true: Processes
  user input from a CES form and return html error message if there
  was a problem.
  The first parameter is the object collection to work on.
  The second parameter is the name of a public method from your plugin that
  will be called if the user submitted a single element form from the
  collection with the collection element as its sole parameter.
  It should return a html string that can be displayed to the user in
  case of processing errors or an empty string if no errors were found.
  Prior to calling your method the element on the form that the user
  submitted will be made the "selected element" in the collection.
  The third (optional) parameter is also the name of a public method in
  your plugin that will be called with the whole collection as parameter
  the user submitted the "extra" block form; prior to calling the
  clear_selectedId() method of the collection will be called.
  

Templates
---------

  The collection Element Selector makes heavy use of the TYPO3 templating
  engine. For it to work, your methods have to return html that follows
  a few constraints:
  - Your method for creating a form for a single element has to deliver
    at least a complete html form (from "<form .." to "</form>")
  - Inside the form you have to have the placeholder
    "###tx_pttools_collectionElementSelector_MetaData###" (without the '"');
    it will be replaced with several hidden fields containing the CES Metadata.
  - This also pertains to the "extra" block, if you provide one.
