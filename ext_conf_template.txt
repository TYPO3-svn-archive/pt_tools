# cat=basic; type=boolean; label=Convert errors to exceptions: Convert errors to exceptions by using set_error_handler(). Errors will be logged as defined in the php.ini (log_errors, error_log) anyhow. Be careful with this options in production environment! You can set which errors to convert by adding "$GLOBALS['tx_pttools_debug']['errors']['FE']" or "$GLOBALS['tx_pttools_debug']['errors']['BE']" to your localconf.php. By default all errors defined in "error_reporting" will be logged in the frontend and all errors defined in "error_reporting" without E_WARNINGS will be logged in the backend. Be sure to catch all exceptions, e.g by switching on the option "catchUncaughtExceptions" below.

# cat=basic; type=boolean; label=Catch uncaught exceptions: Catch uncaught exceptions (by using set_exception_handler()) and display them with a nice backtrace if IP matches the devIPmask respective display only the message if not. If "convertErrorsToExceptions" is set to true, this option should be set as well, as there might be exceptions (coming from errors) which would not be caught otherwise. In combination with TYPO3's "systemLog" this can be a mighty tool for developing and monitoring.
